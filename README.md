## Short Description
Content Managment System client for the Blog project.
- [Main client repo](https://github.com/BookmanJunior/TOP-Blog)
- [API repo](https://github.com/BookmanJunior/TOP-Blog-api)

## What I Learned
- Utilize memo to optimize heavy component(MDXEditor component in this case).
- Utilize forwardRef to retrieve value of a heavy component and prevent otherwise unneccessary rerenders caused by onChange event listener.
- Separate frontend clients which serve different purposes(Main client for users to interact with and CMS for managing content).
- Utilize Vite's .env variables to set urls based on react's mode.
